Documentation
----------------------

The yaml file "assets_offline.yml" needs to be added to the rails config folder. The yaml is split by route name. So the exmaple above can be added to html using "/assets_offline/application". You can add as many root nodes to the yaml as you require and just add the name to the path to get the generated file.

There are 6 sections to add files to in the Yaml
* asset-cache
* cache
* asset-fallback
* fallback
* network
* asset-network

Sections starting asset will use the rails asset_path() helper to get the file path. Non asset sections will use the path specified.
Fallback requires two paths which need to be seperated by a "#"

Manifest file generates a hash key in development this key is changed every 5 seconds so the cache will never function, in production the key is based on the hash of the yaml file. To force a cache refresh you must update the last updated value in the yaml file.

Roadmap
---------
* Rake task to create YAML files
* Automating key update in production mode
* Adding directories to cache file rather than individual files


Changelog
---------

**v0.0.3**

* Beta release
